# STRINGS - Medium

# Two strings are considered close if you can attain one from the other using the following operations:

# Operation 1: Swap any two existing characters.
# For example, abcde -> aecdb
# Operation 2: Transform every occurrence of one existing character into another existing character, and do the same with the other character.
# For example, aacabb -> bbcbaa (all a's turn into b's, and all b's turn into a's)
# You can use the operations on either string as many times as necessary.

# Given two strings, word1 and word2, return true if word1 and word2 are close, and false otherwise.
