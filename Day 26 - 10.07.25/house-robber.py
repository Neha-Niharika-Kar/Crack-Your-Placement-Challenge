# DP - Medium

# You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed.
# The only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and 
# it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

# Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, 
# return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        if n == 1:
            return nums[0]

        dp = [0] * n
        dp[0] = nums[0]
        dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1])

        for i in range(2, n):
            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], nums[i] + dp[i - 2])

        return dp[-1]
