# TREES - Easy

# You are given two binary trees root1 and root2.
# Imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not. 
# You need to merge the two trees into a new binary tree. 
# The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. 
# Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of the new tree.

# Return the merged tree.

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution:
    def mergeTrees(self, root1: Optional[TreeNode], root2: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if not root1 and not root2:
            return None
        if not root1 or not root2:
            return root1 or root2
        
        root1.val += root2.val
        root1.left = self.mergeTrees(root1.left, root2.left)
        root1.right = self.mergeTrees(root1.right, root2.right)

        return root1
