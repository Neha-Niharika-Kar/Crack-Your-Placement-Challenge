# ARRAYS - Medium

# Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove some duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears at most twice. 
# The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

# Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, 
# you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums. 
# More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result. 
# It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.

# Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.

class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) <= 2:
            return len(nums)

        insert_pos = 2
        for i in range(2, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != nums[insert_pos - 2]:
                nums[insert_pos] = nums[i]
                insert_pos += 1

        return insert_pos
